## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I knew some basic CSS already, but this did force me to learn how to deal with image overflow using ```overflow: hidden```. Also learned (or was reminded) a bit about layout and positioning, specifically how to align one element separately from the main flexbox alignment with ```align-self```.

### Continued development

I definitely want to get better at layouts, especially using more flexbox and eventually grid. I also intend to do a lot more with responsive design in future projects, but I want to make sure I have basic CSS down before I start growing and shrinking things.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks: A Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I didn't end up using this as much as I'd anticipated, but it's extremely useful for visualizing similar-sounding flexbox properties and their values.
